# Automated pre-push checks, mirroring everything CI does short of the full
# NXF_VER matrix: nf-core CLI version pin, pre-commit hooks, the slivar
# classification unit tests, a declared-floor version check, nf-test suite,
# and nf-core lint. Fail-fast (set -e) so the first broken step stops the
# script. Harmonized with Post-processing-Pipeline's run-test-suite.sh (the
# fleet reference); the slivar unit-test step (3) is specific to this repo.
#
# pre-commit is also wired into .github/workflows/linting.yml (duplicated on
# purpose), so a local run catches formatting issues before CI does rather
# than after.
#
# There's no commit message lint step here. PR titles are checked on GitHub
# by .github/workflows/ci-pr-title-lint.yml. .github/workflows/commit_lint.yml
# still checks every pushed commit in CI until its removal (pending, see
# docs/journal.md).
#
# Not covered here, left to CI: .github/workflows/nf-test.yml's NXF_VER
# matrix only ever runs the full nf-test suite under this machine's single
# installed Nextflow version (see step 6) -- it does NOT also run the full
# suite under every CI-pinned version (24.10.5, 25.10.4, latest-everything),
# since that would mean installing/switching Nextflow versions and roughly
# quadrupling this script's runtime. Step 4 only smoke-checks the floor.
#
# Note on dependencies: the dry-run and lint steps need nothing but the
# tools themselves, but the real (non-dry-run) nf-test suite still spins up
# Docker containers, and its pipeline-level tests (tests/default.nf.test)
# need the S3 test dataset synced locally (data-test/ -- see CLAUDE.md's
# "Test dataset" section). This script does NOT include the ad hoc, manually
# -inspected `nextflow run` smoke tests -- see scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh for
# those.
#
# Usage: scripts/run-test-suite.sh
